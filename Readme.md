This was a site I was working on for I client I was contracting for. This was ultimately going to be a sort of hub for South Mississippi. Things ended with the client before I got too far into it, so I figured I'd put it up here.

This uses Craft CMS as the back end (the client said this was a must), and React as the front end. They wanted a JS framework for the front end instead of just using Twig with Craft. Ultimately I chose React over Vue and Angular.

The craft folder is for the back end work.

The front folder is for the front end work.
